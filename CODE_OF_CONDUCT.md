### Purpose

The main purpose of our Code of Conduct is to ensure the best possible experience to all Devrel Space community members. We are all here to learn, share and have lots of fun.

This Code of Conduct covers our behaviour in any forum, web site, repository, public online discussion, meetings related anyhow to the activity of our community.

### Core Values

- **Be honest**. We strongly believe that bringing in both positive and negative feedback can let us all grow provided that this feedback is honest and constructive. üë®‚Äç‚öñÔ∏èüë©‚Äç‚öñÔ∏è

- **Be money honest**. As community maintainers we have never intended and will never want the community of all of us to bring us any kind of material profit. We strongly believe that we can handle all potential expenses in the future with help of our partners and sponsors who will kindly take care of financing on their end. üë®‚Äç‚öñÔ∏èüë©‚Äç‚öñÔ∏è

- **Be thoughtful**. Whenever commenting, starting a discussion, suggesting changes or simply exchanging thoughts with other community members, always think whether the message you convey is constructive and foremost appropriate. ü§ì

- **Focus on what is best for the community**. In devrel meat and peace we trust. Collaboration on what will foster our community is our goal.

- **Be patient**. Remember that none of us, the community members, treat this activity as a full-time thing. Simply respect each others' private and personal time. Remmember that pings are welcome, but do not overdo them üòä

- **Be respectful**. We will probably not agree all the time but always remember to show respect toward each other. Only if we treat others with respect, then we will be able to thrive both as a community and personally. üëµüßì

- **Stay positive and be nice**. Only if we feel safe and keep being positive toward each other, then we will be able to keep our community healthy and growing. üññ

- **Be imperfect**. Nobody is expected to be perfect in our community. Asking questions, answering and constantly learning new things is our way of life. ü§î


### Diversity and Inclusion

Diversity is our main strength. We strongly believe that anyone, no matter the ethnicity/ gender/ age/ religion/ disability/ sexual orientation/ education background/ socioeconomic status/ educational background/ sector experience/ personality/etc. have something special that one can contribute so as to make our community even better for all of us.


### Behaviour

Community maintainers are expected to take appropriate and fair action in response to any unacceptable behavior.

They also have a right to remove or reject contributions that are not aligned to this Code of Conduct, or to ban temporarily or permanently any community member for behaviours that they deem inappropriate or harmful.

Harassment includes offensive verbal comments related to gender, age, sexual orientation, disability, physical appearance, body size, race, religion, following, harassing photography or recording, sustained disruption of talks or other events and inappropriate physical contact.

If a community member engages in harassing behaviour, the community maintainers may take any action, including warning the offender or expulsion from our space.

We expect all community members to behave appropriately at all of our events and in our mutual online spaces.

Instances of unacceptable behaviour may be reported by contacting following people:

- Konrad Sopala (konrad.sopala@gmail.com)
- Adrianna Pusz (adrianna.pusz@gmail.com)

All complaints will be reviewed and investigated. Community maintainers will maintain confidentiality with regard to the reporter of an incident.

### Contribution

If you consider something really crucial on the road to making our community more meaningful, feel free to create a branch for yourself and open a pull request. All potential changes to Code of Codnuct must be reviewed by community maintainers, before being merged. Do not forget to assign [Konrad](https://github.com/beardaway), so as to have your PR checked as soon as possible.
