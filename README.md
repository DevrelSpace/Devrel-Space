Welcome to our main space where all the content from all our meetups live ðŸ‘‹. This is the place where we will store all the devrel presentations, decks, and webinar recordings from our presenters but also any developer-oriented projects that you want to share with whole community!

### Organisation

After each meetup/webinar, a new directory with the meetup topic and its date will be created, so that you can easily access all of the valuable knowledge. In terms of the developer-oriented projects that we have mentioned above, there will be a separate folder called **CommunityKnowledge** where you will be able to upload the projects that you have worked on, that you want to share with the rest of community (apps, frameworks, SDKs, plugins, etc.) or simply share any piece of content that you consider valuable in terms of developer-related topics, that you've developed yourself (guides, presentations, notes, etc.).
