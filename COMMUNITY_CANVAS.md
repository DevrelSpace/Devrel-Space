Community means something different to every person. That's why we wanted to create a shared space for the vision of our community that we can all contribute to, so as to make our experience within Devrel Space constantly better.

We highly recommend giving it a look as it will provide you with more fulfilling experience in terms of both sharing and learning. For a more graphical version, you can always visit [Devrel Space Community Canvas Graphics](CommunityCanvas.png).

This canvas would not have been created without great help from [Community Canvas](https://community-canvas.org/). For all the materials and community value they have created, we want to say huge Kudos! üëè

**Contribution**

If you consider something really crucial on the road to making our community more meaningful, feel free to create a branch and open a pull request. All potential changes to our Community Canvas must be reviewed by community maintainers, before being merged.
